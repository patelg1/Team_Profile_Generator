## Description
This is a Node.js command line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

When the application is run, the user is prompted to enter a team name and enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number. The user is then presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or none. When the engineer option is selected, user is prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and user is taken back to the menu. If user selects the intern option, then they are prompted to enter the intern’s name, ID, email, and school, and taken back to the menu. When they decide to finish building the team
then they exit the application, and the HTML is generated.
